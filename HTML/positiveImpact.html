		<p><i>“I rise from my worst disasters, I turn, I change.”</i> – Virginia Woolf</p> <br> <br>
		<p>The same world, but… different.</p> <br> <br>
		<p>Much more than having a bank account to “keep money in a safe place”, it is largely know that having access to the banking system is essential.</p>
		<p>This inclusion goes beyond the credit card or bank accounts: it guarantees to the person a “citizen status”; leading to social inclusion and better control of economic life, especially when it comes to women.</p>
		<p>Currently, we still have almost a third of the world population excluded from the financial system (approximately 1.7 billion people) due to a series of factors ranging from governmental intolerance linked to bank failures in the past, to difficulties in understanding and handling banking activities.</p>
		<p>However, the confinement generated by the pandemic that started in 2020, not only boosted online commerce but also made many stores to adopt a “cashless” system: for the safety of everyone, they avoid handling money and only accept card as payments. In this way, being “banked” became a matter of survival in such unstable times.</p>
		<p>We are proof that it is possible that we do not see people as a product. The fees you pay enable Bankify movement and sponsor social accounts, free of cost and bureaucracy, which are offered to women who cannot pay, through inclusive arrangements in traditional Irish communities, especially those working in the countryside.</p>
		<p>We want to include more people in the financial system in a gradual, continuous and simplified way, that's why Bankify was born.</p>
		<p>A pilot project in Ireland, which aims to include approximately 60,000 adult women without a bank account.</p>
		<p>For these people, we want to give them an identity and the possibility to be more independent under the control of their finances, wherever they are.</p>
